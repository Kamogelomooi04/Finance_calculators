# Finance_calculators

This program allows the user to calculate their interest rate on an **investment** or 
calculate the amount that should be repaid on a **home loan** each month.

This program would be useful to anyone who needs/wants to calculate their interest 
rate on an **investment** or the amount that should be repaid on a **home loan** each month.
It makes life hassle free for the user as there is no need for them to memorise formulae,
which may discourage many people from attempting to calculate. 

The user will be allowed access to two different financial calculators, 
an **investment** calculator and a **home loan** repayment calculator.
User just has to choose which calculator they would like to use. Then the 
user will be prompted to enter the appropriate values needed to complete the calculation.

Wanna try it out? Easy, just push the project to your machine and get going.:rocket:
